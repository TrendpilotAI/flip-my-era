          <p>
            Scrapbooking has always been about preserving memories with a personal creative touch. But let's be real — not everyone has the time, supplies, or crafting skills to create a beautiful physical scrapbook. And in 2025, a digital keepsake makes so much more sense: it's shareable, it can't get damaged, and it lives forever on your devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            FlipMyEra's digital scrapbook combines the personal, memory-preserving spirit of traditional scrapbooking with AI technology that generates stunning original illustrations. You provide the memories, we provide the art. The result is a digital scrapbook that looks like it was crafted by a professional designer — but takes just minutes to create.

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">🎨 AI Illustrations</h3>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Digital Scrapbook Page Ideas</h2>
        <p>Not sure what to include? Here are popular page themes our Swifties create:</p>
        <ul className="space-y-3 mb-8">
          <li>🎫 <strong>The Ticket Page</strong> — How you got your tickets, the Ticketmaster saga, the exact moment you knew you were going</li>
          <li>👗 <strong>The Outfit Spread</strong> — Your era-inspired outfit planning, inspiration photos, and the final look</li>
          <li>📿 <strong>Bracelet Wall</strong> — All the friendship bracelets you made and traded, with the stories behind each one</li>
          <li>🎤 <strong>Setlist Highlights</strong> — Your top moments from each era, surprise songs, and emotional peaks</li>
          <li>👯 <strong>The Squad Page</strong> — The friends you went with, the pre-show rituals, and group memories</li>
          <li>🌟 <strong>The Surprise Songs</strong> — What Taylor played as surprise songs at your show and why they hit so hard</li>
          <li>😭 <strong>The Emotional Moments</strong> — When you cried, laughed, screamed, and felt completely alive</li>
          <li>🏟️ <strong>The Venue</strong> — The city, the stadium, the atmosphere, and the local Swiftie culture</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why Go Digital?</h2>
        <p>
          Physical scrapbooks are lovely, but digital scrapbooks have some serious advantages for the modern Swiftie:
        </p>
        <ul className="space-y-2 mb-8">
          <li>✅ <strong>No craft supplies needed</strong> — save your money for concert tickets</li>
          <li>✅ <strong>Ready in minutes</strong> — not weeks of cutting and gluing</li>
          <li>✅ <strong>Easily shareable</strong> — send to friends, post on social media, or keep private</li>
          <li>✅ <strong>Never gets damaged</strong> — no water damage, torn pages, or faded photos</li>
          <li>✅ <strong>Eco-friendly</strong> — no paper waste or plastic supplies</li>
          <li>✅ <strong>Unlimited copies</strong> — print one or share a thousand</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Combine with Physical Keepsakes</h2>
        <p>
          The best of both worlds: use your FlipMyEra digital scrapbook as the illustrated narrative, and pair it with a physical shadow box or memory jar containing your actual concert mementos — ticket stubs, friendship bracelets, confetti, and wristbands. The digital book tells the story; the physical items are the artifacts. Together, they create the ultimate Eras Tour memory collection.
