          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why Personalized Gifts Beat Standard Merch</h2>
          <p>
            Every Swiftie already has the t-shirt, the vinyl, and the friendship bracelets. But what they don't have? A personalized storybook that tells THEIR Taylor Swift story — how they became a fan, their favorite lyrics, the concerts they attended, and the moments that made them feel seen by Taylor's music.
          </p>
          <p>
            FlipMyEra creates AI-powered custom gifts that are as unique as the person receiving them. Each storybook features personalized narratives, era-specific illustrations, and details that show you truly understand what Taylor Swift means to them. It's the kind of gift that makes someone cry happy tears.

        <p>
          The secret to an amazing personalized Swiftie gift is in the details. When creating your storybook, include specifics that show you really know the person:
        </p>
        <ol className="space-y-3 mb-8">
          <li><strong>Their favorite era</strong> — Is she a Reputation girlie or a Folklore dreamer? This sets the visual tone</li>
          <li><strong>Personal memories</strong> — Specific concerts, car singalongs, lyrics they quote constantly</li>
          <li><strong>Inside jokes</strong> — The AI weaves these into the narrative beautifully</li>
          <li><strong>Their personality</strong> — Shy bookworm? Bold leader? The story adapts to match</li>
          <li><strong>Special dates</strong> — When they became a fan, concert dates, your friendship anniversary</li>
        </ol>
