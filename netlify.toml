# Sentry Netlify Plugin Configuration
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: The @sentry/netlify-build-plugin has been ARCHIVED/DEPRECATED by Netlify.
# If this plugin is installed in your Netlify UI, it will cause build failures if SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN is missing.
#
# RECOMMENDED ACTION: Remove the Sentry plugin from Netlify UI:
# 1. Go to Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Plugins
# 2. Find "@sentry/netlify-build-plugin" or "Sentry"
# 3. Click "Remove" or "Uninstall"
#
# Note: Sentry error tracking still works via the Sentry SDK in your code.
# The plugin only handled release creation, which is optional.
# For Netlify Functions error tracking, use Sentry's AWS Lambda integration instead.
