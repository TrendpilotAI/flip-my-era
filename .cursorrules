# Context7 MCP Configuration for Flip My Era Project

## Project Overview
This is a React/TypeScript application called "Flip My Era" that generates alternate timeline stories based on user input. The app uses:
- React with TypeScript
- Vite as the build tool
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Clerk for authentication
- Supabase for backend/database
- Shadcn/ui components

## Key Technologies & Dependencies
- React 18+
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Clerk Authentication
- Supabase
- Shadcn/ui components
- Lucide React icons
- React Router DOM

```

## Authentication System
- Uses Clerk for authentication
- ClerkAuthContext provides useClerkAuth hook
- Integrates with Supabase for user profiles
- Supports Google OAuth

## Database Schema (Supabase)
- profiles table: user profiles with subscription status
- stories table: user-generated stories
- tiktok_shares table: TikTok sharing analytics

## Key Features
- Story generation based on personality types
- User dashboard with story management
- Ebook generation
- TikTok sharing integration
- Subscription management (free/basic/premium)

## Development Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing component structure
- Use Shadcn/ui components for UI elements
- Implement proper error handling
- Use the existing authentication context
- Follow the established naming conventions

## Common Patterns
- Components use the useClerkAuth hook for authentication
- API calls use the supabase client from @/core/integrations/supabase/client
- Toast notifications use the useToast hook
- Form handling uses React state and controlled components
- Styling uses Tailwind CSS classes

## Important Notes
- The app uses Clerk for authentication, not a custom auth system
- All authentication-related imports should use ClerkAuthContext
- The project has both frontend (React) and backend (Supabase functions) code
- Environment variables should be configured for Clerk and Supabase
