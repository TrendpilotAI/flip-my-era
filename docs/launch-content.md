How it works:

1️⃣ Tell us about your era (childhood, college, early career)
2️⃣ Our AI crafts an alternate timeline — same you, different fate
3️⃣ Get a personalized illustrated ebook you can share or keep

It takes ~5 minutes. The feels last way longer.

Why we built this:

Everyone has a "what if" moment. What if I'd taken that job? Moved to that city? Said yes instead of no?

FlipMyEra doesn't just imagine it — it writes it, illustrates it, and binds it into a story that's uniquely yours.

**First Comment:**
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm the maker of FlipMyEra. The idea started from a late-night conversation about "what if" moments — those turning points where life could've gone differently.

I wanted to turn that universal feeling into something tangible: a beautifully illustrated story that reimagines your past in a kinder timeline.

The AI generates both the narrative and the artwork, so every ebook is completely unique. It's been an incredible journey building this and I'd love your feedback!
